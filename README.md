# Frigoligo [![Chat on Matrix](https://matrix.to/img/matrix-badge.svg)](https://matrix.to/#/#frigoligo:one.ems.host)

Frigoligo is an universal [wallabag](https://wallabag.org/) client made with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).
It is made to be _a lot of super-cool marketing things_ but for now it is just made with love and that's something.

## Deeplinks

Frigoligo supports a few deeplinks that allows it to be integrated in external workflows. All platforms except Linux are supported.

### Links format

Deeplinks are based on a custom scheme, the URI path is used to determine the action to perform.

The follow link will open the app and perform the `action` action with the given parameters `param1` (`hello`) and `param2` (`GÃ¼nther`). Note that the host `x` is just here for readability and is ignored.

```
frigoligo://x/action?param1=hello&param2=G%C3%BCnther
```

### Actions

#### `/articles/:articleId`

Open the article with the given ID respecting the correct app navigation mode.

| Parameter   | Description                             | Required |

# Frigoligo [![Chat on Matrix](https://matrix.to/img/matrix-badge.svg)](https://matrix.to/#/#frigoligo:one.ems.host)

Frigoligo is a [wallabag](https://wallabag.org/) client crafted using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). Its core philosophy is to prioritize pragmatism and adhering to best practices when it makes sense.

Frigoligo is aiming at being:

1. **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid. It should feel light and functional.
2. **Universal**: Provides a consistent experience on Android, iOS, macOS, Linux and Windows.
3. **Pluggable**: Can be integrated into any workflows easily, using deep links and OS integrations.
4. **Offline first**: Works offline as much as possible and keep synchronization efficient.
5. **Innovative**: Experiment with new ideas on top of the solid backend that is wallabag.

## Deeplinks

Frigoligo supports a few deeplinks that allows it to be integrated in external workflows. All platforms except Linux are supported.

### Links format

Deeplinks are based on a custom scheme, the URI path is used to determine the action to perform.

The follow link will open the app and perform the `action` action with the given parameters `param1` (`hello`) and `param2` (`GÃ¼nther`). Note that the host `x` is just here for readability and is ignored.

```
frigoligo://x/action?param1=hello&param2=G%C3%BCnther
```

### Actions

#### `/articles/:articleId`

Open the article with the given ID respecting the correct app navigation mode.

| Parameter   | Description                             | Required |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|----------|
| `articleId` | The wallabag ID of the article to open. | Yes      |

#### `/login`
